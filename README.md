## Description

Tonkey is an advanced project that introduces multi-signature functionality to the TON blockchain. Multi-signature requires multiple authorized parties to jointly approve transactions, ensuring higher security. It uses Elliptic Curve cryptography to verify ownership of addresses. With Tonkey, users can securely manage their digital assets on TON through a transparent process.

## Core Features

1. **Multi-signature Wallet Creation**: Tonkey allows users to create multi-signature wallets on the TON blockchain. These wallets require the approval of multiple authorized parties before executing any transaction, adding an additional layer of protection to the assets held within the wallet.
2. **Customizable Authorization Rules**: The platform offers flexibility in defining the authorization rules for multi-signature transactions. Users can specify the required number of signatures and designate specific parties who must sign off on transactions, tailoring the setup to the needs of their organization or project.
3. **Secure Transaction Workflow**: Tonkey ensures a secure and efficient transaction workflow. When a transaction is initiated, it is sent to the multi-signature wallet, and the required number of authorized parties must provide their signatures before the transaction is executed on the TON blockchain.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Tonkeyâ€™s user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate. Users can efficiently manage their multi-signature wallets and transactions without the need for specialized technical knowledge.
